# php-hyperclick package

Open the class files when you trigger `ctrl` + `left click`.

Proudly powered by a weekend project.

## Inspired by

* [js-hyperclick](https://github.com/AsaAyers/js-hyperclick/)
* [atom-autocomplete-php](https://github.com/Peekmo/atom-autocomplete-php)

This works with the help of some dependencies

* [Hyperclick](https://atom.io/packages/hyperclick)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) a dependency manager for PHP

## Wishes

* Learn coffee script and port
* Improve all the ugly code

## Known Limitations

* Must need use statement, so things like `\Lib\Hello` will not be located.
* Working state on windows not known
* Most probably in MAC it will work
* There may be other unknown bugs

## Thanks
