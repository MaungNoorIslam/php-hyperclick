# php-hyperclick package

Open the class files when you trigger `ctrl` + `mouse left click`.

![How it works!](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/120454/12533819/51b6cd44-c264-11e5-855c-ecd6437ca43d.gif)

## Inspired by

* [js-hyperclick](https://github.com/AsaAyers/js-hyperclick/)
* [atom-autocomplete-php](https://github.com/Peekmo/atom-autocomplete-php)

This works with the help of some dependencies

* [Hyperclick](https://atom.io/packages/hyperclick)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) a dependency manager for PHP

## Wishes

* Learn coffee script and port
* Improve all the ugly code

## Known Limitations

* Must need use statement, so things like `\Lib\Hello` will not be located.
* Working state on windows not known
* Most probably in MAC it will work
* There may be other unknown bugs

## Thanks

Special Thanks to

* Marco Pivetta
* Shameer C
* Wouter J

and to everyone who have helped knowingly/unknowingly to make this happen.
